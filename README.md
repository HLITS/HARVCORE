# HARVCORE
The HARVCORE ontology extension defines Harvard Specific additions and modifications to bibliotek-o and BIBFRAME 2, and is intended to be used as a supplement to bibliotek-o and the core BIBFRAME 2 ontology. It is product of the Mellon Foundation-funded Linked Data for Libraries - Labs and Linked Data for Production projects. See http://ld4l.org for more information on these projects.
